"Selenium" is an umbrella project for various tools and libraries that build and run 
scripts which automatically run web browsers. 

Software Freedom Conservancy is the non-profit corporate home of the Selenium Project 
made possible by volunteer contributors who make the source code freely
available under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/COPYING).

The authorative master repository of selenium is at
https://code.google.com/p/selenium/.  It also mirrored on GitHub
at https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium.

Selenium is a chemical element "Se", found in trace amounts.
But it was adopted as the name of the software tool
because the element is taken as treatment for overdose of another chemical element, mercury ("Hg").

Mercury is the name of an earlier automation tool (QTP/UFT) that Selenium seeks to replace.
Unlike Mercury tools currently, one can write interchangable code for all major web browsers.

Amongst other things it provides the support infrastructure for the W3C WebDriver specification
(https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html) 
for writing interchangable automation code for major web browsers.

The Selenium Server is needed in order to run either Selenium RC style scripts or Remote Selenium Webdriver ones. 
## Selenium 1 = Selenium RC (Remote Control)
is now deprecated in favor of Web Driver.
It requires a java-based Selenium server to broker between the script and the browser.
Its advantage is that it doesn't care if the object is visible or not.

## Selenium 2 Web Driver (Server)

In 2008 Selenium 2 resulted from merging RC into **Web Driver**,
a collection of language-specific APIs that drive a browser, particularly dynamic pages handling Ajax requests
with HTML5 elements. It began as part of HTMLUnit, but got subsumed by Selenium users
around 2006 by Simon Stewart (https://twitter.com/shs96c, at Facebook).

Instead of downloading selenium-server-standalone-2.45.0.jar, see 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-server-standalone-jar to use

```
npm install --save-dev selenium-server-standalone-jar
```

### Selenium IDE

Selenium IDE is a Firefox extension to record and playback Selenium scripts.

### Selenium Grid

is an automation framework for running in a multi-threaded environment.
