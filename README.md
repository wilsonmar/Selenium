# Selenium
Selenium testing

Selenium is an umbrella project for various tools and libraries that build and run 
scripts which automatically run web browsers.

Selenium is a chemical element, found in trace amounts.
But it was adopted as the name of the software tool
because the element is taken as treatment for overdose of another chemical element, mercury.
And mercury is the name of an earlier automation tool that Selenium seeks to replace.

Amongst other things it provides the support infrastructure for the W3C WebDriver specification
(https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html) 
for writing interchangable automation code for major web browsers.

## Selenium 2.0

The Selenium Server is needed in order to run either Selenium RC style scripts or Remote Selenium Webdriver ones. 
### Selenium RC (Remote Control)
is now deprecated in favor of Web Driver.
It requires a java-based Selenium server to broker between the script and the browser.
Its advantage is that it doesn't care if the object is visible or not.


### Selenium Web Driver
is a collection of language-specific APIs that drive a browser, particularly dynamic pages handling Ajax requests
with HTML5 elements. It began as part of HTMLUnit, but got subsumed by Selenium users.


### Selenium IDE
Selenium IDE is a Firefox plug-in to record and playback Selenium scripts.
Once installed, it can be invoked from the Tools menu.
It can convert scripts to Ruby, Java, and other languages.

### Selenium Grid
is an automation framework for running in a multi-threaded environment.
