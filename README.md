Selenium 2.0

The Selenium Server is needed in order to run either Selenium RC style scripts or Remote Selenium Webdriver ones. 
### Selenium RC (RemoteControl)
is now deprecated in favor of Web Driver.

### Selenium Web Driver
is a collection of language-specific APIs that drive a browser, particularly dynamic pages handling Ajax requests
with HTML5 elements.

### Selenium IDE
Selenium IDE is a Firefox plug-in to record and playback Selenium scripts.
Once installed, it can be invoked from the Tools menu.
It can convert scripts to Ruby, Java, and other languages.

### Selenium Grid
is an automation framework for running in a multi-threaded environment.
